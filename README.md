# rdf-tests
Repository for the RDF Tests Community Group

See the [gh-pages](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-tests) branch for the main contents.

The index.html files are built using a Ruby tool-chain based on the corresponding manifest.ttl files. Update using `rake`. Requires Ruby, rdf-turtle and json-ld gems to be installed.
